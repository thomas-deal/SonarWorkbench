\section{Arrays}\label{sec:array}

An array is a collection of elements. Each element in an array has a position and orientation in the array frame. The array itself also has a position and orientation in the body frame. Sonar Workbench supports arrays with mixed element types, e.g. vector sensor arrays with a mix of hydrophones (omnidirectional elements) and accelerometers (cosine elements). The array structure has fields which contain this information.

The field \texttt{.Ne} holds the integer number of elements in the array. The position, orientation, and element type fields are all column vectors of length \texttt{.Ne}. The user is free to choose any convenient element order, as long as that order is consistent across all fields. A (3 $\times$\texttt{.Ne}) matrix determines the element positions in the array frame, \texttt{.ePos\_m}, with rows corresponding to $x$, $y$, and $z$, respectively, in units of meters. An additional (3 $\times$\texttt{.Ne}) matrix determines the element orientations in the array frame, \texttt{.eOri\_deg}, with rows corresponding to roll, pitch, and yaw, in degrees. Table~\ref{tab:ArrayFields} summarizes the fields in the array structure.

		\label{tab:ArrayFields}
		\begin{tabular}{c|l} 
			\textbf{Field} & \textbf{Description} \\
			\hline
			\texttt{.Ne} & number of elements \\
			\texttt{.Net} & number of unique element types \\
			\texttt{.Element} & vector of length \texttt{.Net} element structures \\
			\texttt{.ePos\_m} & element position matrix (m) \\
			\texttt{.eOri\_deg} & element orientation matrix ($^\circ$) \\
			\texttt{.eindex} & element type index (optional) \\
		\end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsection{Arrays with uniform element types}

When all the array elements are identical, the array structure does not need the \texttt{.eindex} field. An example array structure is found in \texttt{SampleArray.m}, shown in Listing~\ref{lst:SampleArray}.

This planar array contains 50 rectangular elements arranged in a grid 5 elements wide by 10 elements high. The geometry is shown in \figname~\ref{fig:SampleArray}, with elements numbered according to their order in the array structure.

\subsection{Arrays with mixed element types}

For mixed-element arrays, the \texttt{.eindex} field must be a row vector of length \texttt{.Ne} integers. The user must first define an element structure array, with one entry for each unique element type. The \texttt{.eindex} field for each element must contain the 1-based index into the element structure array corresponding to its element type. The maximum value allowed is \texttt{.Net}.

An example is included in \texttt{SampleVSCardioid.m} for a simple vector sensor. The relevant portion is shown in Listing~\ref{lst:SampleVSCardioid}. This vector sensor consists of four elements: a hydrophone and three orthogonal accelerometers. The three accelerometers are identical except for their orientations, so there are a total of two unique elements. The hydrophone is \texttt{VS.Element(1)}, and the accelerometer is \texttt{VS.Element(2)}. The array structure is named \texttt{VS}, and the hydrophone is the first element, followed by the $x$, $y$, and $z$ accelerometers. This makes the first entry in \texttt{.eindex} equal to 1 and the rest of the entries equal to 2. Rows two and three of \texttt{.eOri\_deg} rotate elements 3 and 4 from the $x$ axis to the $y$ and $z$ axes, respectively.
